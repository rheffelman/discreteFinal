Discrete Structures Final Project

This repo concerns a discrete structures final project on the simulation of 5-card poker with 1 wildcard
in the deck using string encoding of a deck of cards in C++.

Many files in here are archaic/not worth looking at.
The following files are basically the only ones worth looking at:
Discrete_Final_Project.pdf // a pdf of the final paper on the project.
finalPaper.tex // the LaTeX code for the final paper.
main.cpp   // an up-to-date well rounded version of the simulator for the project. It's a standalone simulator.
mostConsistent.cpp // perhaps the most up-to-date version. It's also a standalone poker simulator.
HCI.cpp // somewhat trivial program. Ir computes a statistic mentioned many times in the paper given a vector of probabilities.
multithread.cpp // a very archaic version of the project, my failed attempt at using multithreading to use CPU more efficiently in my simulations.
