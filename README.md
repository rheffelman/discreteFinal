Discrete Structures Final Project<br />

This repo concerns a discrete structures final project on the simulation of 5-card poker with 1 wildcard<br />
in the deck using string encoding of a deck of cards in C++.<br />

Many files in here are archaic/not worth looking at.<br />
The following files are basically the only ones worth looking at:<br />
Discrete_Final_Project.pdf    // a pdf of the final paper on the project.<br />
finalPaper.tex    // the LaTeX code for the final paper.<br />
main.cpp       // an up-to-date well rounded version of the simulator for the project. It's a standalone simulator.<br />
mostConsistent.cpp    // perhaps the most up-to-date version. It's also a standalone poker simulator.<br />
HCI.cpp    // somewhat trivial program. Ir computes a statistic mentioned many times in the paper given a vector of probabilities.<br />
multithread.cpp    // a very archaic version of the project, my failed attempt at using multithreading to use CPU more efficiently in my simulations.<br />
